There are several JVM-specific databases, such as H2,Cloudscape/Derby, Quadcap QED, hSQLDB, Daffodil, SmallSQL, FirstSQL/J, mckoi DB, LucidDB. The Python+sqlalchemy approach makes high coding efficiency on database access. Due to the fact that Cython doesn't have native support for JDBC interface, Jython+zxjdbc is the workaround to gain access to these JVM-specific databases. This project's aim is to extend the database supporting feature in sqlalchemy by creating dialects for these databases.
